# PAUL VALDEZ PORTFOLIO

## DESCRIPTION

Static page portfolio that can be used to broadcast projects and an optional blog.

* Built this static website using GatsbyJS.

* Arranged for the UI to include smooth scroll functionality using React Scroll.

* Laid out a contact form that's carried out with Netlify's form submission services.

* Enabled automatic TLS certificates with Let's Encrypt to secure the domain.

* Custom SCSS styling written with BEM-IT naming conventions in mind.

My portfolio was built from scratch using GatsbyJS. I spend my time adding my flavor to the dark-themed design.

***Biggest Challenge:*** Setting up the contact form. I had to restructure the entire site to go from being split up into several static pages into one single page to make sure my contact form would function properly.

***Current Objective:*** Add my blog! It would be built upon from my Developer's Blog Application [here.](https://unruffled-bartik-96bf86.netlify.com/). The master branch of this portfolio is already equipped with the blog, it would just need to need to be styled and be added as a route in a navlink.

Live Demo can be found [here.](https://valdezdev.com)
(I also have a smaller scale [Demo](https://spenserkearns.com))

## INSTRUCTIONS
* In a terminal, change to the directory: ```cd gatsby-portfolio``` and launch the command: ```gatsby develop```
* Once the development server starts up, it should route the browser over to ```localhost:8000```. Feel free to test it out and experiment with the blog!
